            It’s well known that social media is a marketing channel which many ecommerce brands have already

            Before we get into the nitty gritty of building a social media marketing plan for your ecommerce business,
            it’s important that you establish goals and targets for what you want to achieve when using
            the marketing channel.

            When you’re establishing goals for your social media marketing plan, we advise against selecting vanity
            metrics (likes / retweets) as your main metric for success. Whilst these are nice to see, and worthwhile
            to measure, they don’t directly affect your business’ growth. Instead, we recommend measure metrics that
            are likely to lead to sales, like leads generated, or conversion rate.
